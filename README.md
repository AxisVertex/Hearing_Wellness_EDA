# Hearing Wellness EDA

This is my 5th EDA Project that i have done
This project explores the Hearing Wellness dataset using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adharshinikumar/2025-hearing-wellness-survey/data

Findings:
* Young people shows more concern for their hearing health and shows interest for apps for wellness apps
* Old people shows less interest in their hearing health and wellness apps
* Longer use of headphones causes discomfort for the ears
* Younger people experiences fear of missing out compared to older people

Overall:
* Overall, the data shows that younger people are more concerned and protective of their hearing. They also experience the Fear of missing out (FOMO) when facing hearing issues. On the other hand, Older people tend to to have less concern about their hearing and show less interest on wellness apps, likely due to already having a hearing problems that are hard to prevent. The data also shows that the prolonged use of headphones can cause discomfort to the ears.

What i've learned:
* Ive learned how to do EDA with categorical dataset (though i still need more practice to be proficient)
* I must only show what the data show
* Suggest possible interpretations but have to be cautious.
